# Pigeon Sim

A flight simulator where you are a pigeon.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5183.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `W` / `S` | Pitch down / up |
| `A` / `D` | Roll left / right |
| `Q` / `E` | Yaw left / right |
| `Space` | Flap — costs stamina, climbs about 3 m/s |
| `Shift` | Tuck the wings and dive |
| `R` | Respawn |
| `H` | Hide the tuning panel |

Turning is done by banking, not by yawing. Roll into the turn and the tilted
lift vector pulls you round; the tail keeps the nose following the flight path.

**Buildings and trees are solid.** Hit one above 7.5 m/s of closing speed and
the run is over. Slower than that and you just scrape to a stop, so a careful
landing is survivable — but so is brushing a wall, which is deliberate.

## Stack

| Concern | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Build | Vite |
| Language | TypeScript, strict |
| Rendering | Three.js |
| Live tuning | lil-gui |
| Tests | Vitest |

## Layout

```
src/
  sim/         flight model, 3D math, collision — pure, no renderer imports
  render/      scene, bird rig, chase camera, HUD, game-over panel
  world/       layout.ts generates the city as data; city.ts turns it into meshes
  input.ts     keyboard to control axes
  run.ts       per-flight statistics
  debug-gui.ts live tuning panel
  main.ts      fixed-timestep loop, wiring
```

The one rule worth keeping: **`src/sim/` never imports Three.js.** That is what
makes the flight model unit-testable and lets the renderer be replaced without
touching the physics.

## How the flight model works

`src/sim/flight.ts` is a simplified aerodynamic model rather than an arcade
approximation, because the interesting behaviours fall out for free that way —
stalls, spiral dives, trading height for speed, banking into a turn.

Each tick it computes angle of attack and sideslip in the body frame, looks up
lift and drag coefficients, and applies lift perpendicular to the airflow, drag
along it, and a keel force resisting sideways slip. Rotation is rate-commanded
rather than torque-based: control inputs ask for a body rotation rate, damped
toward the target, and scaled by an authority term that falls off with airspeed
so a stalled bird goes limp until it has dived back up to speed.

Two details matter more than they look:

- **`trimAngle`** is the angle of attack the bird settles at with no input. It
  stands in for a tail's incidence. Without it, pitch stability trims the bird
  to zero lift and it simply falls out of the sky.
- **Fixed timestep** (120 Hz, with the renderer interpolating between ticks).
  A variable-dt flight model cannot be tuned, because every constant you pick
  is quietly a function of frame rate.

Default numbers land close to a real feral pigeon: 0.35 kg, ~15 m/s cruise,
2.1 m/s sink, roughly 7:1 glide ratio, and about 14 seconds of continuous
flapping before stamina runs out.

Everything in `FlightParams` and `CameraParams` is bound to the on-screen panel.
Tuning live is the intended workflow — the committed defaults are a starting
point, not an answer.

## How collision works

`src/sim/collision.ts` sweeps the bird's movement segment against axis-aligned
boxes, one per building and tree, grown by the bird's radius. Sweeping rather
than testing the end position matters: in a tucked dive the bird covers most of
a tree in a single tick, and a point test would pass straight through it.

A uniform grid over the XZ plane keeps the broad phase to a handful of
candidates — 20,000 sweeps against the full 1,400-object city run in well under
a second, which the test suite asserts so the grid cannot quietly regress into
a linear scan.

On contact the closing speed along the surface normal decides what happens:
at or above `crashSpeed` the run ends, below it the bird stops at the surface
and slides along it. Set `crashSpeed` high in the panel's `collision` folder to
make the world non-lethal while tuning handling.

Tree collision boxes are 30% narrower than the cones look, so clipping a leafy
edge does not read as hitting a wall.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

46 tests across three files:

- **`src/sim/flight.test.ts`** — the shape of the lift curve, glide ratio and
  sink rate staying in a plausible band, flapping climbing and draining stamina,
  tucked dives outrunning spread ones, banking producing a heading change with
  no yaw input, pitch stability recovering to trim, ground contact, crashes and
  survivable scrapes, determinism, and that no input sequence produces a NaN.
- **`src/sim/collision.test.ts`** — entry faces and normals, radius expansion,
  nearest-hit ordering, boxes spanning several grid cells, and a fast segment
  that a point test would tunnel through.
- **`src/world/layout.test.ts`** — flies a bird through the *actual* generated
  city and asserts it crashes into the skyline, never ends up inside a solid
  box, passes clean overhead when high enough, and that the broad phase stays
  fast.

Because the city layout is plain data with no Three.js in it, that last file
tests the real world the player flies through, in Node, with no WebGL.

## Where this goes next

1. **A real pigeon.** `src/render/bird.ts` is primitives behind a two-method
   interface; replace it with a glTF model and a skeletal flap loop.
2. **Air.** Thermals over rooftops and ridge lift off building faces — add a
   wind field sampled at the bird's position and subtract it from velocity
   before the aerodynamics run.
3. **Sound.** Wind noise pitched by airspeed and a wingbeat driven by
   `flapPhase`. This is the cheapest large gain available.
4. **Something to do.** Perching, breadcrumbs, racing through gaps — the
   collision layer already reports the surface normal, so landing on a roof
   rather than crashing into it is mostly a matter of deciding what a gentle
   touchdown on a horizontal face should mean.
5. **A crash you can see.** The bird currently freezes at the impact point.
   Tumbling it, or leaving a puff of feathers, would cost little.
